# native-js-watch
This is a JavaScript watch that detects any changes made to the DOM just like angular does.

This works on IE 5.5+, FF 2+, Chrome, Safari 3+ and Opera 9.6+

Usage:

```
<script type='text/javascript'>

    onDomChange(function(){ 
        alert("The Times They Are a-Changin'");
    });

</script>

```
